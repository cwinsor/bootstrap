# bootstrap
This git implements the "Bootstrap" following "An Introduction to the Bootstrap" by Bradley Efron and Robert J. Tibshirani (1993 by Chapman &amp; Hall, 1998 by CRC Press LLC)

The Bootstrap "is a computer-based method for assigning measures of accuracy to statistical estimates." In essence - it is a computer-based approach to establishing standard error of a model that is based on an empirical sample.  It allows establishing significance to experimental results, and gives a straightforward, step-by-step approach that can be applied to a wide variety of situations, including complicated distributions and complicated measures.

This git includes python code that implements Bootstrap. The examples are taken from the text.
